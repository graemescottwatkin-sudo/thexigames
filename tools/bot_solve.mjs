/* bot_solve.mjs — how a bot reaches full time in each game, unaided.
 *
 * NO BOT IS EVER TOLD AN ANSWER. That was the design question behind item 14
 * and it settles the whole shape of the thing: if a bot needed the bank, the
 * bank would have to reach CI, and a public repo with the forward bank in its
 * secrets is a worse problem than the one the bot was solving.
 *
 * It does not need it. Every game can be finished from what the server already
 * hands a browser:
 *
 *   wordsearch  the grid IS the puzzle and the list of words is printed beside
 *               it, because that is what a word search is. Withholding the
 *               PLACEMENTS never made it unsolvable by a machine — it made the
 *               SERVER the judge, which is what makes the score mean anything.
 *               Searching eight directions finds all eleven in milliseconds.
 *   hilo        higher or lower, and a wrong call still settles the row, so a
 *               fixed call reaches the end of the chain every time.
 *   scrambled   a name reveal per slot; the shop is part of the game
 *   vowels      the same
 *   crossword   a reveal per entry
 *
 * NOTHING HERE TOUCHES THE NETWORK. It is the reasoning half, so it can be
 * proved offline against real boards; tools/play_bot.mjs is the half that
 * talks to a site.
