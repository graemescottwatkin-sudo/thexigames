/* play_bot.mjs — a bot that actually plays the live site, and reports breakage.
 *
 * The other half of item 14. /api/preflight asks whether the coming boards are
 * well FORMED; this asks whether today's board can actually be PLAYED — the
 * question that needs a running server rather than a shape rule, because what
 * it exercises is the WIRING: that production applies its own scoring rule to a
 * real play, on a clock it kept, against fouls it recorded.
 *
 *   XI_BOT_CODE=... node tools/play_bot.mjs
 *   XI_BOT_CODE=... BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8788 GAMES=wordsearch node tools/play_bot.mjs
 *
 * IT IS NEVER TOLD AN ANSWER. tools/bot_solve.mjs does the reasoning and
 * proves — against production's own judge — that every word on a board is
 * findable from the grid a browser is given. No bank reaches CI, which is the
 * whole reason this is possible on a public repo.
 *
 * IT SIGNS IN, AND IT FAILS CLOSED IF IT CANNOT.
 *
 * Ten sessions a night is roughly 3,650 rows a year and half of them carry a
 * real server-verified score — the kind that would sit in a challenge table.
 * So every play is made AS ONE ACCOUNT, created by DEVICE CODE rather than
 * Google: no name, no email, just a random string and some scores. Excluding
 * the bot from any table ever built is then one user_id, forever. Decided
 * before the first run, because retro-fitting it means working out which
 * historical rows were bots — and by then nobody can.
 *
 * A bot that could not sign in must NOT fall back to playing anonymously: that
 * is precisely the row nobody can identify later. No code, no run.
