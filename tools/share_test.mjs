/* share_test.mjs — how a result leaves the site, in every game.
 *
 * Every game already wrote share TEXT. What only Crossword XI had was
 * somewhere to send it — a native sheet with a copy fallback, named buttons
 * for the places a football result gets posted — and a Challenge control. So
 * three games had the words and no envelope, which is the same shape of gap
 * as the settings cog and the keyboard before it.
 *
 * The point of this suite is that there is now ONE row, mounted by four
 * games, rather than four rows that agree today. A game keeping its own
 * platform buttons is the drift this exists to refuse.
 *
 *   node tools/share_test.mjs        (from the repo root)
