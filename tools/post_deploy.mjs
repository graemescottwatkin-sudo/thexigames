/* post_deploy.mjs — record what is live, by deriving it rather than being told.
 *
 *   node tools/post_deploy.mjs            show what it would write
 *   node tools/post_deploy.mjs --write    write it
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The post-deploy bump was four hand-edits across two files:
 * LAST_SHIPPED and LAST_SHIPPED_ASSETS, per game. It was skipped often enough
 * that LAST_SHIPPED once sat two releases behind what was live, which widened
 * the range the gate could not refuse — and that stale gate is what let a
 * client fix nearly ship under an unchanged cache key.
 *
 * IT DERIVES, IT DOES NOT ACCEPT. Every value written is computed here:
 *   - the tag comes from the LIVE page, not from the tree and not from an
 *     argument, so a tag can only be recorded once production is serving it;
 *   - the hash is computed from the tree's own asset bytes;
 *   - and it refuses unless the live tag equals the tree's tag AND that game's
 *     live_check passes. A bump recorded for a deploy that never landed is
 *     worse than no bump: it is a gate reporting a version nobody is serving.
 *
 * The game list is the contract's, read from tools/aligned_test.mjs. A new
 * game is a row THERE and nowhere else.
