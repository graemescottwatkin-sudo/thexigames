/* verify_lineups.mjs — read an XI off the source, not off a summary.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Board data was first gathered by fetching pages through a summarising model.
 * That model returned "Bernardo Silva — Spain". He is Portuguese, and the raw
 * article says so: `{{flagicon|POR}} [[Bernardo Silva]]`. Nationality is the
 * hint field on a club board, so that one wrong value would have shipped a
 * board that lies to the player about the thing they spent a hint on.
 *
 * A summary is not a source. This reads the article wikitext itself and parses
 * the lineup table, so the nationality on a board is the nationality printed
 * in the table, character for character, with nothing paraphrasing in between.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT DO
 *
 * It checks a board against the page. It cannot tell you the page is right, and
 * it cannot check a board whose source is not a Wikipedia match report — the
 * Aston Villa v PSG board is sourced from Sky and has to be read by hand.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node research/tools/verify_lineups.mjs fetch "<page title>"     cache one page
 *   node research/tools/verify_lineups.mjs show  "<page title>"     print both XIs
 *   node research/tools/verify_lineups.mjs check                    compare every board

/* PORTED from the research repo's verify_lineups.mjs, pointed at the bank and

 *
 * It answers the question build_scrambled.js structurally cannot: is a board
 * that is internally consistent also FACTUALLY RIGHT. The board data was first
 * gathered through a summarising fetch which returned "Bernardo Silva - Spain";
 * he is Portuguese, and nationality is the hint field on a club board, so that
 * one value would have shipped a board that lies to the player about the thing
 * they spent a hint on.
 *
 * WHY IT MUST NOT FETCH HERE. Upstream this tool caches from Wikipedia. As an
 * import gate that would be a multi-minute network job failing for reasons
 * that have nothing to do with the boards — the author's own sweep read
 * 202 -> 248 -> 256 -> 264 purely from re-running after rate limits, with
 * nothing else changed. Pointed at the pinned snapshots it is instant and
 * deterministic, and it checks the boards against the article state they were
 * verified against rather than whatever the article says today.
 *
 * A missing snapshot is a REFUSAL, not a fetch and not a skip.
