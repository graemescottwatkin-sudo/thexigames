/* tools/build_scrambled_tester.js — one file you can open, or email to a phone.
 *
 *   node tools/build_scrambled_tester.js
 *   -> scrambled-tester.html  (gitignored; not part of the site)
 *
 * WHY THIS IS GENERATED RATHER THAN WRITTEN
 *
 * A hand-written test harness is a second implementation of the game, and a
 * second implementation drifts from the first — which is this project's whole
 * fault pattern, and would be worse here than usual: the harness would look
 * right while testing something the site does not do.
 *
 * So nothing here is retyped. Every library, every endpoint handler and the
 * engine itself are read from their real files, mechanically stripped of their
 * `import` and `export` lines, and inlined. The only thing this file adds is a
 * fetch() shim that routes /api/scrambled/* into the same handler functions
 * Cloudflare would invoke. If a handler is wrong, the tester is wrong the same
 * way — which is the point of testing in it.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT TELL YOU. There is no server, so today's XI is in the file
 * you are holding: View Source shows every name. On the site the names never
 * leave the Worker. Do not hand this to anybody you want to play the board.
