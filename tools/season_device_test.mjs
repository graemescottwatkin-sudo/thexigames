/* season_device_test.mjs — the season a player keeps without an account.
 *
 * season_test.mjs proves the RULE. season_store_test.mjs proves the half that
 * writes to D1 for a signed-in player. This proves the OTHER branch: the
 * device's own record, written by shared/xi-plays.js at the same two moments,
 * and read by the hub.
 *
 * THE THREE THINGS THAT MATTER HERE
 *
 *   1. The day is the SERVER'S. A device clock must never key a season row —
 *      a phone an hour behind would file a Tuesday as a Monday, and the two
 *      branches would then disagree about the same play.
 *   2. There is ONE rule. shared/xi-season.js is the file the Functions
 *      import, so a season computed on the hub and a season computed on the
 *      server are the same arithmetic, not two spellings of it.
 *   3. A start and a finish both get recorded, from the real xi-plays.js,
 *      running against a fake fetch — because "the games call this at the
 *      right time" is the claim, and grepping for a function name would not
 *      test it.
 *
 * No jsdom: xi-plays.js needs a window, a document that takes listeners, a
 * navigator and two storages, and those are small enough to build honestly.
 * A fake that is right while the code is wrong is worse than no fake, so
 * localStorage here is a real string store with a real quota failure mode.
 *
 *   node tools/season_device_test.mjs        (from the repo root)
