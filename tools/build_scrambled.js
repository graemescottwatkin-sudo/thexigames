 *   node tools/build_scrambled.js --check    build and gate, write nothing

 *
 * SCRAMBLES ARE GENERATED HERE AND STORED, NEVER DERIVED IN THE BROWSER
 *
 *   1. Every player must see the same board, or a shared score compares
 *      nothing. A scramble computed at load time from an unseeded shuffle is a
 *      different puzzle per device.
 *
 *   2. A scramble derived at runtime is derived from whatever string is in the
 *      data, and the whole point of the English-form gate is that the string
 *      might be wrong. Generating here means the gate runs before anything is
 *      stored, and a bad name never becomes a board at all.
 *
 * THE LAYOUT IS DERIVED FROM THE FORMATION, NOT AUTHORED BESIDE IT. The draft
 * carried `formation: "4-4-2"` next to a hand-written list of bands and slot
 * ids: one fact in two places, and the day they disagreed the board would have
 * been captioned 4-4-2 and drawn as something else. Here the string is parsed
 * and everything else falls out of it.

 *   under hardBelow letters   HARD    every letter may move — as deranged as
 *                                     the letters allow, never the answer
 *   hardBelow..easyAbove      MEDIUM  mediumFixedShare of the letters stay put
 *   over easyAbove            EASY    easyFixedShare stay — several anchors
 *
 * The fixed count is the PRIMARY control and is hit exactly, not fished for:
 * a shuffle that keeps lucky hits works at the hard end and hangs at the easy
 * end (exactly 8 fixed of 13 is one shuffle in a hundred thousand). So the
 * anchors are CHOSEN first and only the movers are deranged among themselves,
 * and the target is met by construction. Movement is SECONDARY: among the
 * arrangements that hit the target, the half whose moved letters travelled
 * furthest is discarded and one of the rest is picked at random — the random
 * pick matters, because a recurring player must not be recognisable by the
 * shape of his tile.
 *
 * REPEATED LETTERS count by what the player can see: a letter is fixed when it
 * stands where the answer shows that letter, and travel matches each moved
 * letter to the nearest unclaimed copy of itself. Swapping GIGGS's two Gs is
 * not a move. The derangement floor (2k-n per repeated letter) still bounds
 * the hard end from below: one of GIGGS's three Gs stays because it must.
