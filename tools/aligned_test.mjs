/* aligned_test.mjs — the contract every game in the family signs.
 *
 *   node tools/aligned_test.mjs        (from the repo root)
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, WRITTEN THE NIGHT BEFORE GAME THREE. With one game, there
 * is nothing to align. With two, every shared fact quietly grew a second copy
 * and one of them drifted: the palette declared twice, the chrome grown twice,
 * the CSRF header named per-game, the tag law real in one gate and a costume
 * in the other ("v000" — a check that compared every build against nothing),
 * a merge rule that agreed by coincidence until two devices disagreed forever.
 * Game three triples every one of those opportunities on the day it lands.
 *
 * THE SHAPE. One GAMES table. Every check below runs identically for every
 * row. Adding a game is adding a row — and the moment it is added, the whole
 * contract applies to it. A check that must be copied per game would itself
 * be the fault this suite exists to end.
