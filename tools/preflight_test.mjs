/* preflight_test.mjs — the forward check, and the gate in front of it.
 *
 * /api/preflight walks the next N days of every game's schedule and reports
 * what is wrong with the boards it finds. Two properties matter more than the
 * rules themselves:
 *
 *   1. IT NEVER RETURNS A BOARD. Not a grid, not an answer, not a name, not a
 *      clue — not even for a board it is reporting as broken. The whole reason
 *      this exists rather than a bot with admin is that a leak costs one fact.
 *   2. IT FAILS CLOSED. No secret configured means no access, and no database
 *      means a refusal rather than fourteen perfect sample days.
 *
 * The boards below are built by hand and then BROKEN one way at a time, so
 * every rule is exercised by the fault it is there to catch. A rule that no
 * fixture can fail is a rule that will not fail in production either.
 *
 *   node tools/preflight_test.mjs        (from the repo root)
