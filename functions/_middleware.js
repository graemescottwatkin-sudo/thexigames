/* functions/_middleware.js — what every Function-served response must do.
 *
 * TWO FAULTS, ONE FILE, found by external review of v001m.
 *
 * FAULT 1 — HEAD 404'd on every Function route. Pages does not derive HEAD
 * from GET: a handler exporting only onRequestGet never sees a HEAD request,
 * so it fell through to the static handler and 404'd. Static pages answered
 * HEAD fine, which is exactly why nobody noticed — the crawler-facing pages
 * that diverged were the Function-served ones, and /football/crossword/answers/ is IN
 * the sitemap at priority 0.7. With the wordsearch archive now live, every
 * answers page in BOTH games had this. The fix is the only honest HEAD there
 * is: run the GET, keep the status and headers, drop the body.
 *
 * FAULT 2 — _headers applies to static assets only. The `/api/* X-Robots-Tag:
 * noindex` rule and the site-wide security headers decorated precisely the
 * HEAD 404 from fault 1 and reached no real Function response. One handler
 * (wordsearch/puzzle) set its own noindex, so the pattern existed in one file
 * and was absent from the general case — a rule that lives in one handler is
 * not a rule. They are set here, once, on the way out.
 *
 * Headers are set only where absent, so a handler that says something more
 * specific (the answers pages' own Cache-Control) is never overruled.

  /* CASE IS NOT PART OF THE ADDRESS, and until 20 Sep 2026 it was.
   *
   * URL paths are case-sensitive in the spec and Cloudflare Pages honours
   * that, so /Football/Crossword/ 404d while /football/crossword/ served.
   * Nobody types a URL carefully and nobody writing a link gets the case
   * right, so the visitor who capitalises the way the site capitalises its
   * own headings — FOOTBALL / CROSSWORD — met a 404. The sites that appear
   * not to care are either on Windows, where the filesystem is
   * case-insensitive, or are doing exactly this.
   *
   * WHAT IS SAFE TO LOWERCASE, having checked rather than assumed: every
   * segment this site puts in a path is already lowercase. Game and theme ids
   * come from validGame, which lowercases before it matches, so an id with a
   * capital in it could never resolve anyway. Board keys are numbers and day
   * keys. The one identifier that carries capitals — the word search's
   * XIWS-0001 — travels in the QUERY STRING, and the query is not touched
   * here: only url.pathname is folded, and to.search carries through
   * untouched.
   *
   * 301 RATHER THAN 302, which is the opposite of the call made for
   * /football/ and for the same reason read the other way. That redirect is
   * temporary because its target changes the day a second theme lands. This
   * one's target is the lowercase form of the address, which cannot change:
   * it is idempotent, the destination is the canonical URL, and a permanent
   * answer is what stops Google holding two URLs for one page.
   *
   * GET AND HEAD ONLY. A 301 is allowed to turn a POST into a GET and would
   * drop its body; nothing posts to a mixed-case path, and leaving other
   * methods alone means this cannot quietly break a write. */

  /* HEAD: routing chose the handler chain by method BEFORE this middleware
     ran, so for HEAD there is no onRequestGet in the chain and next() — even

     404s. Proven locally: the 404 came back wearing this middleware's own
     X-Robots-Tag. The only way to answer HEAD with the GET's truth is to ASK
     for the GET: a depth-one self-fetch (HEAD → GET → handler → back), then
     status and headers without the body. One subrequest per HEAD, and HEAD
