/* POST /api/verify   { token, entry, guess }  ->  { correct }
 *
 * The free one. As you type, the game asks whether a completed entry is right
 * so it can mark it solved and know when the puzzle is finished. It costs
 * nothing, it happens constantly, and it tells you nothing you did not already
 * type — the answer is not returned, only a verdict on what you supplied.
 *
 * It exists as its own door so that /api/check-answer can be paid by
 * definition. They were one endpoint, identical requests, and the server had to
 * be told which kind it was looking at — which meant a browser that omitted the
 * flag got its checks for nothing. Now the server needs nobody's word: a
 * request that arrives here is free, a request that arrives there is charged,
 * and the tally is the server's own count either way.
 *
 * Deliberately no `detail`. Which letters are wrong is what the paid check
 * buys; this only ever says yes or no, so it cannot be used as a free one.
