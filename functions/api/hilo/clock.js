/* POST /api/hilo/clock — { playId, token }
 *
 * "The current call's clock starts now." Sent twice in a round's life: at kick
 * off, and after a wrong call when the player taps Next.
 *
 * WHY THE PAGE SAYS IT AT ALL, when the point of this work is that the server
 * owns the clock. After a RIGHT call the next call is shown immediately, so
 * its clock starts when the server answered the last one and nothing is asked.
 * After a WRONG call the round waits for a tap, and the wait is not thinking
 * time. Somebody has to say when the tap happened and only the page was there.
 *
 * It is safe because it can only ever move a clock LATER, which costs the
 * player points. There is no version of this a cheat would want to send.
