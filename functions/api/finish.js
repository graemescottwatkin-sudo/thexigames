/* POST /api/finish   { token, playId, letters }  ->  the score
 *
 * The score is the server's. The browser sends what it typed; the server marks
 * it, reads the help it served, times it from the row it wrote when the board
 * was pulled, and returns a number. Whatever the page shows is a display of
 * that number, not a calculation of it.
 *
 * Every input is something the browser cannot influence:
 *
 *   correct   the answers are here, so the grid is marked here
 *   help      every check and reveal came through this server
 *   time      started_at was written by this clock
 *
 * The clock is wall time from the moment the board was pulled, and the game's
 * pause is not honoured. That is a deliberate difference from the local score:
 * a pause the server cannot observe is exactly where a leaderboard would be
 * gamed, so a verified score is timed from the start of the sitting. The
 * device's own score is unaffected and still pauses.
 *
 * It also fixes something unrelated to cheating. Completion used to require
 * every entry to have been verified individually, so a player who filled the
 * last square with no connection got nothing at all — no Full Time, no score —
 * until eleven separate requests had landed. One call now marks the whole grid,
 * so finishing offline works the moment the connection returns.
