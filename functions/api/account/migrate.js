/* POST /api/account/migrate  { game?, club?, results: [...] }
 *
 * A guest who signs in must not lose what they have already played. The
 * browser posts what it has in localStorage once, and it is written against
 * the new account.
 *
 * This is the foundation, not the finished article. Two rules make it safe to
 * build on:
 *
 *   - Migrated rows are marked `source = 'migrated'`, so a leaderboard can
 *     later choose to trust only rows it recorded itself. Everything here came
 *     from a browser and cannot be verified after the fact.
 *   - A daily is unique per player. Signing in twice, or migrating twice, tops
 *     up what is missing rather than duplicating a run — a streak built on
 *     duplicates would be meaningless.

/* THE SUBSTITUTIONS COLUMN READ A SPELLING NO PAGE WRITES.
 *
 * It was intOr(r.substitutions). Of the games that spend substitutions, only
 * Codeword writes that word: Ballpark and Who Am I write `subs`, HiLo writes
 * `subsUsed`, QuickFire writes `subs` from a variable called subsUsed. So the
 * column has been 0 on every row of every game but one, silently, since it
 * existed — the value was on the wire and the reader was asking for another
 * name.
 *
 * This is the word search's puzzleId fault exactly, and games_test already
 * carries the lesson from it: "EVERY field, not most of them. Two were handled
 * for both spellings and two were not." That was fixed for one function and
 * the same mistake was sitting one file away in a column mapping.
 *
 * Found on 16 Sep 2026 while adding detail for Ballpark, by asking what the
 * page actually sends rather than what the INSERT asks for. Nothing errors
 * either way, which is why it lasted: a zero is a plausible number of
 * substitutions and there is no row anywhere that looks wrong. */
