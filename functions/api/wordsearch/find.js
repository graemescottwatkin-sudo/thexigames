/* POST /api/wordsearch/find — { playId, from:[r,c], to:[r,c] }
 *
 * THE SELECTION GOES UP AND THE SERVER SAYS WHAT IT HIT. This is the whole
 * inversion: the board no longer travels with its answers, so the page cannot
 * judge a drag and does not try. It sends the two squares; this matches them
 * against placements the browser has never been given, and hands back the one
 * word that was found — with its placement, because the player has just earned
 * it and the page needs it to draw the line.
 *
 * A miss is a FOUL and is recorded as one. The penalty escalates with
 * consecutive wrong selections, so the row carries when it happened and the
 * escalation is derived from the sequence at full time — the same rule the
 * page applies to the same data.
 *
 * WHAT THIS WILL NOT DO. It will not say "warm", it will not say which word
 * you nearly had, and it will not confirm a square. A no is a no, and anything
 * more is the board leaking a letter at a time.
