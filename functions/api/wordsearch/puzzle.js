 * One released board, whole. The guard is the reason this endpoint exists:
 * a board whose first scheduled day is still ahead is refused with a 404 that
 * names nothing — not the theme, not the category, not whether the id exists.
 * A refusal that says "that's next Tuesday's" has already leaked what it
 * guards. Unknown id and unreleased id are the same answer on purpose. */

     Deliberately a different answer from the 404 above. That one refuses to
     admit a board exists, because naming an unreleased board leaks the
