/* POST /api/scrambled/guess  { token, guess, solved: [] }  ->  { solvedId }

 * MARKING HAPPENS HERE EVEN THOUGH THE BROWSER COULD DO IT. The names are on
 * the server, and sending them to the page so it can compare strings would put
 * today's whole XI in the payload — which is the one thing publicBoard() is
 * for. The scramble gives away the letters; it does not have to give away the
 * spelling and every accepted alias too.
 *
 * ONE UNIVERSAL ANSWER BOX, NO SLOT SELECTION. The guess is checked against
 * every slot the player has not already solved, and the id of the one it
 * matched comes back. That is the original design — solve in any order — and
 * it leaks nothing: a name that matches a slot IS correct, so there is no
 * "right player, wrong slot" state to accidentally confirm.
 *
 * `solved` is the player's own claim about their progress and is not trusted
 * with anything. Lying about it can only re-solve a slot they already had.
