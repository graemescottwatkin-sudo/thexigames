/* POST /api/scrambled/reveal  { token, slotId, kind }
 *
 *   kind "hint"    the board's own hint field — club, nationality or career.
 *                  Answers for EVERY slot: it is one purchase, not eleven.
 *   kind "letter"  the next letter of the name, in position
 *   kind "name"    the name, which ends that slot
 *
 * `known` is how many letters of that slot the player already has, so the
 * server does not need a session to know which letter comes next. It is the
 * player's own claim and can only be used to ask for a letter they could have
 * bought anyway, one purchase at a time.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ENDPOINT DOES NOT DO, AND SHOULD BEFORE IT SHIPS: it does not
 * record the purchase. The score is therefore assembled in the browser and the
 * game says so on the Full Time card. A trusted score needs a play row with a
 * started_at the server wrote and a count of the reveals it served — the same
 * shape Crossword XI uses. Until that exists, "unverified" is the truth.
