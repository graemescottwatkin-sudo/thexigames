     A number above today is ANSWERED WITH TODAY, not refused. The refusal
     dead-ended a real player, nightly: the server's day flips at midnight
     UTC, the browser's at local midnight, so every UK summer night between
     twelve and one the client computed tomorrow's number, asked for it, got
     403 "not available yet", and the daily was a toast on an empty pitch.
     The client-side recovery for a number disagreement — adoptServerBoard,
     "the server owns the calendar, so its answer wins" — was already written
     and already right, but it only runs when a BOARD comes back; a 403
     carries nothing to adopt. Clamping the ask is what lets the stated
     principle actually operate.

     Nothing leaks: the clamped answer is today's board, which is what the
     asker is entitled to. And this is the ASK only — check, reveal, verify
     and finish still validate tokens through playableDailyNo, where a claim
     about a future board stays refused. Asking is a question; a token is a
     claim. */
