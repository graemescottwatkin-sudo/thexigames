/* POST /api/source — { token, entry, guess }  ->  the citation behind a clue
 *
 * The owner's rule: "i dont mind sharing sources but i dont want it mass
 * requested by a single user." So a citation is no longer handed down with a
 * verdict. /api/verify still says whether an entry is right and still says
 * whether a source EXISTS, but the link itself is asked for here, by an
 * account, one press at a time, counted, and capped at fifty a day.
 *
 * THE GUESS IS SENT AGAIN, AND CHECKED AGAIN. That is the whole security of
 * this endpoint. Around one row in seventeen has its answer inside its own
 * URL — the international-caps clues are sourced to per-player pages, so
 * Buffon's clue cites a page named after him — which is why a source has
 * never travelled with a board. An endpoint that handed over a citation for
 * an entry index alone would be a way to read those answers without solving
 * anything, and it would be a worse leak than the one the allowlist exists to
 * prevent. So the proof of having solved the clue is the same proof verify
 * asks for: the answer itself.
 *
 * WHAT EACH REFUSAL SAYS. Signed out is 401 and says so, because the player
 * is being asked to register and a page cannot draw that button from a 403.
 * Out of presses is 429 and names the ceiling. A wrong guess is the same
 * "correct: false" verify gives, and costs nothing — a press is spent on a
 * link handed over, never on a request made.
