/* POST /api/play — how far people get.
 *
 * Two events per attempt: one when a puzzle starts, one when it ends. The end
 * event carries how many clues were solved, which is the number that matters —
 * a daily that 142 people start and 12 finish is a different problem from one
 * that 40 start and 38 finish, and no page-view tool can tell them apart.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT COLLECT
 *
 * No cookie, no account, no address, nothing derived from the person. The play
 * id is random, made when the puzzle starts and forgotten when it ends: it
 * pairs a start with its finish and identifies nobody. Two attempts by the same
 * player are indistinguishable from two players, which is the price of not
 * following anyone around, and worth paying.
