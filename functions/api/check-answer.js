/* POST /api/check-answer

 * Body: { token, entry, guess }           is this entry right?
 *       { token, entry, guess, detail:1 } ...and which letters are wrong
 *       { token, grid }                   is the whole grid right?
 *
 * The answer is compared here and only a verdict goes back.

     a player who has paid nine points with ten failed requests. The fix is one
