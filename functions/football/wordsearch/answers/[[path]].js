/* GET /football/wordsearch/answers/          — every published board, newest first
 * GET /football/wordsearch/answers/XIWS-NNNN — one board's answers
 *
 * WHY THESE PAGES CAN EXIST AT ALL. The crossword's answers are a secret the
 * server keeps — they are never sent to the browser, so publishing them is an
 * act with a seal on it. A word search is the opposite: the daily payload
 * already carries every answer and placement, because the answers are readable
 * off the grid by construction. The ONLY secret this game has is the schedule
 * — which board is tomorrow's — and these pages leak nothing about it.
 *
 * THE SEAL. A board's answers publish once its FIRST scheduled day is more
 * than ANSWERS_AFTER_DAYS old — the crossword's own constant, imported from
 * the one place it lives. No second seven anywhere: if the window ever
 * changes, both games change together. A board scheduled again later does not
 * re-seal; its answers were public the first time and pretending otherwise
 * would only make the page lie.
 *
 * THE REFUSAL. A sealed or unknown board gets the same 404: no theme, no
 * names, no hint of whether the id even exists. no-store, noindex — a cached
 * refusal would outlive its release date, and an indexed one is a page about
 * nothing. Identical posture to /football/crossword/answers/.
 *
 * ADDRESSED BY BOARD, NOT BY DAY. The schedule maps 730 days onto 374 boards,
 * so a day-addressed page would publish the same board twice under two URLs —
 * duplicate content, and a second copy of one fact.
