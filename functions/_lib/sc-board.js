 *
 *   - the hint values, which are the priced help
 *   - the aliases, which name the exact spellings that will be accepted and
 *     would narrow a solver's search
 *   - every OTHER day's board, which is the leak that actually matters and is

     * Wednesday" rather than "Aston Villa + Reading". Nothing failed anywhere.

     * a wrongly ordered array; this refuses to REORDER a correct one. Either
     * alone leaves the other free to break it in silence, and the two repos
     * cannot see each other. */

   the same key topClubs merges by, so it is a statement about this function's
   contract rather than about any particular board. It says nothing about

   order. This half only says we did not shuffle it. */
