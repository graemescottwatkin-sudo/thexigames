/* hl-board.js — HiLo XI: the one place a stored board becomes a public
 * payload, the rule for which board is today's, and the judge.
 *
 * THE SECRET IS THE VALUES. A board is twelve items in a fixed order; the
 * player sees the first value and calls the eleven that follow. Every value
 * after the first, and every row's source, stay on the server until that call
 * is made — the browser is given names and context up front so it can draw
 * the live pair, and one value per call, judged here. A board with its values
 * in the payload would be a board with its answer key in the payload.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF BOARD. A DAILY board is the calendar's for one day; the past
 * is open (a missed day can be caught up as free play) and the future is
 * shut, because opening it gives away everything. A CLUB board — a club's
 * managers by year of appointment — is never in the calendar and is playable
 * from the club's own page whenever it is in the bank.
 *
 * THE BANK COMES FROM D1 WHEN IT IS BOUND, AND FROM THE SAMPLE WHEN IT IS
 * NOT — three boards that travel with the repository so a fresh clone, the
 * suites and an unbound preview have something real to play. `source` rides
 * in every payload so a live check can refuse a run that quietly fell back.

 *
 * IT MUST NAME EVERY FAMILY, or the boards it misses are buried alive.
 * It read `(managers|head coaches)` and matched 54 of the 274 club boards in
 * the September import. The other 220 — a club's Premier League appearances,
 * goals and assists, and the one longest-spell board — would have been filed
 * as dailies, and a daily that is not on the calendar is refused by
 * released(). They would have imported green and been unplayable and
 * invisible: not on the club pages, because clubOf() returned null, and not
 * playable, because no day names them.
 *
 * THE PREFIX IS REQUIRED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DIFFICULTY. Seven daily
 * boards are categorised "Premier League appearances" with no club in front,
 * beside 113 that read "Arsenal Premier League appearances". A rule that
 * matched on the tail alone would swallow the dailies too, so the club name
 * is `(.+\S)` — at least one character, non-blank — and a bare category
 * cannot satisfy it. Checked against all 363 boards of the import: 274 club,
 * 89 daily, no daily claimed and no previously-club board lost. */
