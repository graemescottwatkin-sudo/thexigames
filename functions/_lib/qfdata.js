/* functions/_lib/qfdata.js — QuickFire XI's only route to D1.
 *
 * Two rules this file exists to hold:
 *
 *  1. A board is served on its play date and not before. There is no fallback
 *     sample: an unbound binding must look like a broken game, not a working
 *     one with a handful of boards. That fallback is what let the word search
 *     run for weeks on sample data with every check green.
 *
 *  2. Nothing leaves here that the player is not entitled to today. A challenge
 *     link can only rebuild questions that have already been played, so a
 *     hand-crafted code cannot read tomorrow's board.

/* THE FOUR OPTIONS ARE SELECTED, and the order they come back in IS the order
   they are shown — there is no stored position, because position is derivable
   from the rule the importer enforces: exactly one option equals `answer`.
   Storing it too would be a second statement of which button is correct, free
   to drift from the first.
   SELECTED ONLY BECAUSE THE IMPORTER NOW REFUSES A ROW THAT BREAKS THAT RULE.
   These columns existed in the schema from 13 September, written by nothing and
   read by nothing; selecting them before anything validated them would have
   served unvalidated options to players, which is worse than serving none — a
   player picks the right option and is told they are wrong. The order is
   importer first, reader second, and it is not interchangeable.
   A row mid-pivot has four NULLs here, which renders as no options rather than
   as four blank buttons. */
