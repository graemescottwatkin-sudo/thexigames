/* functions/_lib/auth.js — sessions and identity.
 *
 * Design decisions worth knowing, because they are the ones that are expensive
 * to change later:
 *
 * 1. No passwords, ever. Identity comes from Google (and later Apple), verified
 *    server-side. There is nothing here to leak or to reset.
 *
 * 2. Sessions are an opaque random id in an HttpOnly cookie, with the row in
 *    D1 — not a JWT in localStorage. A token readable by script is a token any
 *    injected script can take, and this game renders clue text from a database.
 *
 * 3. The primary key is an internal id, never the email. Emails change, and
 *    people sign in to the same account through different providers.
 *
 * 4. State-changing endpoints require a custom header. Cookies are sent
 *    automatically by the browser on cross-site form posts; a header is not, so
 *    requiring one is a simple, dependency-free CSRF defence. SameSite=Lax is
 *    belt and braces on top.
