/* Word Search data access — the one place the release rule lives.
 *
 * THE RULE: a board is released once its first scheduled day is today or
 * earlier. Unreleased boards are refused with a 404 that carries not one word
 * of the board — the refusal is the security property, same as the crossword's
 * answers pages. Everything else (daily, free play, catalog) is a lookup.
 *
 * THE DAY: the server decides what day it is, in UTC, exactly as
 * /api/daily does for the crossword. The browser never computes a date and
 * sends it up; it asks. Changing a device clock changes nothing.

     puzzles" from before the game existed, and claimed the word search had a

     listed as a past board and cannot be linked to is the same fault twice, so
     the archive is bounded by exactly the set that is addressable and the two
     can no longer disagree.

     WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX, and it is one day rather than 238: the word search
     went live on 27 August and day one of the family is the 26th, so that
     board is listed a day before the game served it. Left alone deliberately —
     removing it needs a per-game launch date, which is a new fact to keep, and
