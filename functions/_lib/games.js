 * does not touch the schema and it does not touch an endpoint.

/* ---- WHEN EACH GAME LAUNCHED, and it is one fact in one place -----------
 *
 * WHY IT HAD TO BE WRITTEN DOWN. Three separate pages were reasoning about
 * "before this game existed" and none of them could ask anything:
 *
 *   - the word search's "previous puzzles" list offered 238 boards from
 *     before the game was built, because ws_schedule was pre-filled with two
 *     years of inventory from 1 January 2026 and the query read every day
 *     before today as a day the game had run;
 *   - its ANSWERS pages published 233 boards on the same reasoning, and 233
 *     of those are scheduled to run in the FUTURE — full placements and the
 *     secret bonus word, for boards nobody has played yet;
 *   - every game's archive index and the sitemap listed boards from 1 to
 *     today, which for Vowels (launched on the 4th) is ten boards from days
 *     the game did not exist.
 *
 * A SCHEDULE CANNOT ANSWER IT. For HiLo the schedule does begin on the launch
 * day, so it looks like it could — but the word search's begins eight months
 * early and the three ring games have no schedule at all. It is a fact about
 * the GAME, not about its storage, so it lives here beside the family list.
 *
 * The day a game first served its daily, UTC, as YYYY-MM-DD. Null means not
 * launched: QuickFire and Grid XI have boards and no page, and the day one of
 * them launches is the day its date is written here — the same edit that puts
 * it in GAMES, and the importer reads it rather than being told twice.

   GAMES above is "whose rows the account system may write" — results, board
   state, entry keys — and an unreleased game must not be on it, because a row
   written for a game nobody can play is a row nobody will ever read.

   Reporting bad content is not that. A game can be PLAYABLE in the repo before
   it is launched — /football/scrambled/ and /football/quickfire/ both are — and the whole point
   of reporting is to hear about wrong content BEFORE anyone else sees it. A
   built game that cannot be reported is the one stage where reports are most
   useful and least available.

   Derived from GAMES rather than restated, so the released set is written
   once. A game leaves this list only by being deleted.

   Deduped, and that is not decoration. Scrambled was named here while it was
   unreleased, then joined GAMES, and the hand-written half stayed — so BUILT
   held it twice. indexOf did not care, which is why it survived; anything
   that iterates does, and the tracking gate reported the same game twice the
   first time it ran. A game promoted into GAMES should stop being named here
   by hand, and the Set means forgetting costs nothing.

   Grid XI joined on 6 September 2026, at the same stage QuickFire is at: a
   board is playable and judged, and there is no page yet. It is here and NOT
   in GAMES for exactly the reason above — no result row may be written for it
   until it launches — and it needs to be here for the one thing that matters
   before a launch: a play_id, so a round has an owner the server can hang
