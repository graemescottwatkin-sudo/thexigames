/* hl-round.js — the clock the server keeps for a HiLo round, and the record
 * of the calls it judged.
 *
 * WHAT A VERIFIED SCORE IS MADE OF HERE. Every input is something the browser
 * cannot influence:
 *
 *   right    this server judged every call, from values it holds
 *   time     it timed each call from a clock it started itself
 *   order    the calls are keyed by index, so none can be replayed
 *
 * THE ONE THING THE PAGE GETS TO SAY ABOUT TIME, and why it is safe. After a
 * right call the next is shown at once, so its clock starts when this server
 * answered — nothing is asked. After a WRONG call the round waits for a tap of
 * Next, and the wait is not thinking time, so the page says when the clock
 * restarted. That can only move a clock LATER, which costs the player points.
 * There is nothing to gain by lying and no need to trust it.
 *
 * WITHOUT A DATABASE THIS DOES NOTHING, on purpose. Every function answers
 * null and the game plays exactly as it did before a score was verified — the
 * device's own number, which the Full Time card has always said is unverified.
 * A game that stopped working because a table was missing would be a worse
 * failure than an unverified score.
