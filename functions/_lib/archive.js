/* archive.js — how far back anyone may go without an account.
 *
 * Today and the week behind it are open to everybody. Older than that, a
 * board asks the player to register. That is the whole rule, and it is here
 * rather than in four endpoints because four copies of a window is four
 * windows the day somebody changes one.
 *
 * SEVEN, AND THE OTHER SEVEN. ANSWERS_AFTER_DAYS in daily.js is also seven,
 * and this must NOT be written in terms of it. They are two decisions that
 * happen to agree today: one says when a board's answers may be published,
 * the other says when playing it starts needing an account. Tie them together
 * and moving the answers window silently moves the paywall, which is the kind
 * of coupling this codebase has paid for before. Two facts, two constants,
 * and this comment so the next person does not "tidy" them into one.
 *
 * WHAT IS GATED IS THE DAILY ARCHIVE, NOT EVERYTHING OLD. A board is gated by
 * how long ago it was the board of the day. Boards that never had a day — the
 * word search's free-play catalogue, Scrambled's finals, the crossword's club
 * boards — are not part of the archive and are not gated by this. They are a
 * catalogue, not a back issue.
 *
 * AND IT DOES NOT GATE WHERE NOBODY CAN REGISTER. If the site cannot offer an
 * account — no database bound, or no sign-in configured — then "sign in to
 * play this" is a door with no handle, and the archive stays open. That is
 * also what keeps the suites honest: they run without either, so they exercise
 * the ungated path, and the live_checks assert the gate really is up in
 * production, where it is the only place it means anything.
