/* sc-round.js — the clock and the help the server keeps for a Scrambled

 * The same job hl-round.js does for HiLo, and a simpler one: this game has one
 * clock for the whole board rather than eleven, so nothing has to be told when
 * a clock restarts. Every input is already something the server serves:
 *
 *   started   written here, when the round begins
 *   solved    it marks every guess (/api/scrambled/guess)
 *   help      it serves every reveal (/api/scrambled/reveal)
 *
 * WITHOUT A DATABASE THIS DOES NOTHING, on purpose — the same rule the rest of
 * the family keeps. Every function answers null, the round plays exactly as it
 * did before a score could be verified, and the Full Time card keeps saying
 * the number is the device's own.
