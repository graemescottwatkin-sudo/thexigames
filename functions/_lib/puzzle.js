/* functions/_lib/puzzle.js
 *
 * The one place where a stored puzzle becomes a public payload. Every API
 * response that carries a puzzle goes through publicPuzzle(), so there is a
 * single function to audit rather than four endpoints each deciding for
 * themselves what is safe to send.
 *
 * What is removed:
 *   - cells[].ch          the solution letter in every square
 *   - entries[].answer    the answer text
 *   - entries[].grid      the answer with spacing removed
 *   - entries[].entity    the club a clue belongs to, which often gives it away
 *
 * Earlier drafts also sent a salted hash per answer so the browser could tell a
 * typed word was right on its own. Those are gone: every correctness question
 * now goes to /api/check-answer, so the hashes bought nothing and were one more
 * thing an attacker could work against offline. Nothing derived from an answer
 * leaves this function.

/* THE ONE PLACE THAT TURNS AN ENTRY'S CELL INTO A KEY OF THE CELL MAP, and
   it exists because the two are NOT the same shape. `puzzle.cells` is an object
   keyed by the string "x,y" — engine.js key(x, y) — while `entry.cells` is an
   array of { x, y } OBJECTS. So `puzzle.cells[entry.cells[i]]` is always
   undefined, and it is undefined QUIETLY: the lookup yields no letter rather
   than throwing, so a marker reads every answer as blank and a leak scan
   searches for nothing and reports itself clean.

   That is exactly what happened on 20 Sep 2026. The Friends route, its marking
   endpoint and its client all indexed the map with the object, and all three of
   their fixtures hand-built string-keyed entry cells — so the fixtures agreed
   with the bug and every suite passed. It was caught by a POSITIVE CONTROL
   asking whether the scan could see an answer at all: it had extracted 0 of
   1,320. Anything walking an entry's cells uses this. */
