/* sources.js — the citation behind a solved clue, and the rule about which
 * ones a player is shown.
 *
 * WHY A CLUE HAS A SOURCE AT ALL. Sourcing is the owner's one standing rule,
 * and the bank keeps it: every live row carries `source` (one to three URLs),
 * `sourceName` (the publisher, as a label) and `prov` (an editorial
 * provenance note). The daily boards embed the whole bank row in their
 * payload, so the citation has been in the database all along — it simply
 * never left the server, because publicPuzzle() rebuilds each row from a
 * whitelist that does not include it.
 *
 * IT IS RELEASED ON SOLVE, NEVER WITH THE BOARD. Around one row in
 * seventeen has the answer inside its own URL — the international-caps clues
 * are sourced to per-player pages, so Buffon's clue cites a page named after
 * him. Sending citations down with the board would hand those answers over.
 * So a source is returned by /api/verify and /api/check-answer at the moment
 * an entry is confirmed correct, which is the same rule HiLo already keeps
 * for its per-call sources.
 *
 * WHICH SOURCES ARE SHOWN. A private record of where a fact came from and a
 * link put in front of a player are different things. The bank cites
 * bookmakers on 224 live rows and a user-editable wiki on 132 more, which is
 * fine as provenance and not fine as a link on a football puzzle that
 * children play. So this is an ALLOWLIST, not a denylist: a domain nobody has
 * approved shows no link at all. A gap is a gap; a link to a betting site is
 * a decision nobody made. The rule lives on the server so a browser never
 * receives a URL it is not allowed to show, whatever the page does with it.
 *
 * The list grows by asking. As the bank's own re-sourcing lands the shown
 * proportion rises without a line of this changing.
