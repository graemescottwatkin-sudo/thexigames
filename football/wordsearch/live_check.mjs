/* live_check.mjs — is the deployed Wordsearch XI actually behaving?
 *
 *   node wordsearch/live_check.mjs [--expect v001g]
 *
 * The crossword has had one of these since the restructure; the word search
 * shipped without one, and every post-deploy check was done by hand with curl.
 * Two of tonight's faults would have been caught by the checks below the day
 * they happened rather than the day somebody looked:
 *
 *   - hasDB() falls back to SAMPLE boards when the D1 binding is missing, so
 *     an unbound database looks like a working game with a handful of boards.
 *     The `source` field is the tell, and nothing was reading it.
 *   - migration 002 sat unapplied for months behind a comment claiming it had
 *     been run, and every results query threw into a silent catch. The schema
 *     probe below asks the live endpoints the question directly.
 *
 * Assertions only ever READ. Nothing here plays, finishes, or writes.

   everything after it outside the completion guard as well. A crash in the
