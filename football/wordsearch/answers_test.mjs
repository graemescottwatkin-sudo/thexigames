/* answers_test.mjs — the Wordsearch XI answers pages.
 *
 * What is being protected: the ONLY secret this game has is the schedule.
 * The answers themselves ship in every daily payload by construction, so
 * these pages leak nothing — provided the seal holds, the refusal says
 * nothing, and no address distinguishes "sealed" from "does not exist".
 *
 * The handler runs for real against a stub D1, the same way functions_test
 * exercises the API. Assertions about a page nobody rendered are assertions
 * about a comment.
