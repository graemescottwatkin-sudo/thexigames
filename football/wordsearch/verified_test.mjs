/* verified_test.mjs — the score Wordsearch XI's server computes, and the two
 * leaks that had to close before it could compute anything.
 *
 * This game could not have a verified score. The board travelled whole — grid,
 * every answer, every answer's exact placement, and the secret bonus word — so
 * the page judged its own drags and the score it reported was a number the
 * browser chose. Withholding the placements was not enough on its own either:
 * /api/wordsearch/puzzle?id=<today's id> handed the same board back complete,
 * to anyone, because released() passes a board first scheduled today.
 *
 * So the checks here are in three groups, and the first two are the ones that
 * would still matter if the scoring were abandoned tomorrow:
 *
 *   what the browser is given          the grid and the words, nothing more
 *   what the other routes will not give today's board, by any door
 *   what the score is made of          rows this server wrote, and cheating it
 *
 *   node football/wordsearch/verified_test.mjs        (from the repo root)
