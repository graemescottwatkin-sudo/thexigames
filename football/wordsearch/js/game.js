/* Wordsearch XI — game.js (v500, the ground-up rebuild)
 *
 * Crossword XI's architecture, applied where it fits and not where it
 * doesn't. The bank and the schedule live in D1 behind /api/wordsearch/;
 * the browser asks for one board at a time and never learns tomorrow's.
 * There is no check-answer and no reveal endpoint on purpose — a word
 * search's answers are readable off its own grid by construction, so
 * server-side validation would add a round-trip per drag and protect
 * nothing. What the server guards is the schedule.
