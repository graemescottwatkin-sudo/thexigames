/* deploy_check.mjs — Wordsearch XI's gate.
 *
 * Crossword's 34 checks, split honestly: the general ones carried over, the
 * crossword-specific ones left behind, and the two bank checks adopted
 * AS-WRITTEN — they only became true of this game when the bank moved to D1,
 * and narrowing them to pass earlier would have made the gate lie.
 *
 * Every check corresponds to something that has happened once, here or on
 * the crossword. Counts assertions, because a gate that does not count
 * cannot tell a silent skip from a pass — v4.3's tokens check note()d for
 * every build it existed and never failed once.

   < v002.

   MAINTAINED, unlike its first draft. This sat at "v000" from the day the
   game shipped: the check compared every build against nothing and could not
   fail — a tag law half-implemented is the crossword's discipline worn as a
   costume. The constants are real now and the deploy ritual bumps them, same

   failed it. Every commit after a post-deploy bump was red until the next
   release, on every game, including games the commit never touched. Red
   that is expected is red nobody reads, which is worse than no gate.

   Nothing is lost by allowing equal. The pairing below is the check that
   carries the law: if the bytes changed, the tag must have moved; if they
   did not, it must not have. Equal with unchanged bytes is exactly right,
   and equal with changed bytes is what that check refuses. What is left

   Every existing tag check passed: they ask whether the four tags AGREE and
   whether the tag is AHEAD of LAST_SHIPPED, and both were true of a tag that
   had not moved since the last deploy. The property nobody was checking is
   the one that matters — if the bytes changed, the tag must have changed too.

   LAST_SHIPPED_ASSETS is the other half of LAST_SHIPPED: what is live is a
   tag AND the bytes it names. Both move together, in the post-deploy commit.
