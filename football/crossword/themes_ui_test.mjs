/* themes_ui_test.mjs — the Themed section in a browser.
 *
 * themes_test.mjs proves the boards and the API. This proves the part a player
 * touches: the three panels, the request marker, the readable share link and
 * — the one that worries me most — the third save slot. A themed board is a
 * real game with a real clock, and until this build there were two slots for
 * three modes, which is how a themed board would have quietly destroyed a
 * practice game in progress.
 *
 * /api/themes and /api/theme-board are served from fixtures here rather than
 * from the real Functions, because those need a database and what is under
 * test is the browser's half. The API's own half is themes_test.mjs.
