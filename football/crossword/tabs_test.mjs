/* tabs_test.mjs — more than one window open on the same game.
 *
 * localStorage is shared by every tab on an origin. Three windows open meant
 * three clocks and three ten-second saves writing the same two keys, last
 * write winning — so a tab left open since the morning could overwrite the
 * board being typed into now, and an admin reset came back to life within ten
 * seconds because another window still held a copy in memory.
 *
 * HONESTY ABOUT WHAT THIS PROVES. jsdom gives each window its own storage and
 * does not deliver storage events between instances, so this harness bridges
 * them by hand: window A's writes are copied into window B and a StorageEvent
 * is dispatched there, which is what a browser does. That tests the handler
 * and the stand-down, NOT the browser's event delivery. The real thing needs
 * two tabs and a person; render_test.mjs territory. Written down because a
 * test that quietly stands in for something it cannot reach is worse than no
 * test at all.
