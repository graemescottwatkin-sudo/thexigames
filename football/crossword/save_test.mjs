/* save_test.mjs — the saved game, and what is allowed to overwrite it.
 *
 * Every check here exists because of a real loss. A daily in progress was
 * replaced by a well-formed empty record, and the menu carried on displaying
 * the old time because nothing re-rendered — so the damage only surfaced at
 * the next reload, which made the reload look like the culprit.
 *
 * The other suites boot one page and drive it. These need a save already in
 * storage *before* any script runs, and several need a second page load, so
 * this file opens a fresh window per case and seeds localStorage in
 * beforeParse. Storage is carried from one window to the next by hand, which
 * is what a reload does.
