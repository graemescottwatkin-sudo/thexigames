/* adopt_test.mjs — the account's journey reaches the SCREEN, on a normal open.
 *
 * This suite exists because three faults stacked in one feature and 994 green
 * assertions covered all three.
 *
 *   1. The pull sat inside the clock-clamp branch (server daily number !==
 *      ours). On a normal open the numbers agree, the branch is skipped, and
 *      the pull never ran at all. Nothing ever reached the device.
 *   2. Adoption called adoptServerBoard(), which only re-freezes the board
 *      identity object. Even had the pull run, nothing repainted.
 *   3. The push had no letters-or-time floor, so a device showing a blank
 *      board could overwrite another device's journey with nothing.
 *
 * state_test asserts the RULES by reading the source: the debounce is wired,
 * Date.now is absent from the comparison, the floor exists. Every one of those
 * passed throughout. None of them opens a board and looks at it.
 *
 * So this file drives the real page in jsdom, on the NORMAL path — the server's
 * number agreeing with ours, no clamp — and asserts the account's letters are
 * in the rendered grid. A suite that only exercised the clamp path would pass
 * on fault 1 for ever.
