   (v001 -> v001b -> v001c). A tag is BURNED the moment its package is
   presented — v154 alone was rebuilt six times under one name, which made
   "--expect v154" prove a string while proving nothing about the tree, the
   duplication fault applied to release numbers. Packages are folders named
   for the game: Crossword_v001, zipped as Crossword_v001.zip.

   The old lineage (v124..v156) is retired; numbering restarted at v001. The
   comparison below knows about that one reset — an old-lineage LAST_SHIPPED
   (>= v100) with a new-scheme build passes with a note. Once LAST_SHIPPED is
