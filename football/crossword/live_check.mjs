/* What the live site is actually doing.
 *
 * The gap this fills: every suite in this repo runs against the working tree.
 * They tell you the code is right; they cannot tell you the deploy landed, the
 * migration took, or that the build being served is the one you pushed. Three
 * things this week were only findable on production — v148 shipping while v126
 * was still live, migration 017 being unapplied, and the browser storing its
 * own clock beside the server's score.
 *
 * Reads only. It never posts a score, never starts a play, never signs in.
 * Safe to run against production at any time.
 *
 *   node live_check.mjs
 *   node live_check.mjs --expect v150
 *
 * Anything it cannot see from outside is listed at the end rather than passed
 * over in silence — a check that quietly skips is worse than no check.
