/* chrome_test.mjs — the furniture every game wears.
 *
 * The chrome exists because two games grew two chromes: a green bar with game
 * navigation and no way home, and a paper bar with family navigation and no
 * game navigation. Worse, the crossword's in-game view used a THIRD header
 * with no navigation at all, so opening a board stranded you on it.
 *
 * What this suite is for: the properties that make it one chrome rather than
 * two that currently look alike. Every one of them is a thing that drifted
 * apart before — the palette, the game's name, the build tag, the list of
 * games in a footer.
