/* render_test.mjs — CrosswordXI real-browser layout and behaviour gate
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * viewport_test.mjs reasons about the CSS *text* and says so honestly in its
 * own header: "jsdom does no real layout, so this cannot judge appearance."
 * That is a fair statement of its limits, and it means an entire class of
 * defect is invisible to it — the class that cost Wordsearch XI five
 * release cycles to find:
 *
 *   - a long puzzle title wrapping to two lines and pushing the grid below
 *     the fold on 20% of puzzles
 *   - the result modal rendering off-screen while its buttons reported as
 *     enabled
 *   - grid cells losing their square aspect because the font was larger than
 *     the cell
 *   - scroll position retained through a view transition, so the player
 *     landed mid-page with the header cut off
 *   - controls measuring 28px on a phone
 *
 * None of those are visible in a stylesheet. All of them are visible in one
 * getBoundingClientRect() call.
 *
 * This harness measures the rendered page in real Chromium across the full
 * device matrix. It is deliberately a *gate*, not a report: it throws.
 *
 * THE FLEX LAYOUT
 * ---------------
 * The board no longer has to fit. It sits in a frame it pans and zooms inside,
 * so a board taller than the frame is the feature rather than a defect, and
 * "the grid ends within the viewport" would now fail on every puzzle that used
 * the space it was given.
 *
 * What must hold instead: the FRAME is on screen and has room in it, the square
 * being typed into is visible within the frame, and the toolbar and clue card
 * are both reachable. Those are asserted when body carries .flex-layout; the
 * old board-fit assertions still run on the classic path, which remains in the
 * file until this gate has been run against flex on real hardware.
 *
 * USAGE
 * -----
 *   npx wrangler pages dev .            # in one terminal, so the API works
 *   node render_test.mjs                # in another
 *
 *   BASE=https://crossword.thexigames.com node render_test.mjs
 *
 * Requires: npm i -D playwright  (then npx playwright install chromium)
 *
 * EXPECT IT TO FAIL ON FIRST RUN. That is the point — the failures are the
 * audit. Fix, re-run, and from then on it protects what you fixed.

      /* THE BOARD A FRESH PLAYER IS SHOWN IS LEGIBLE.
         Thirty-two pixels is this file's own floor, stated here rather than
         read out of game.js: a test that imported the threshold it is checking
         would agree with any value the game happened to hold, including a
         broken one. It is the same kind of claim as MIN_TAP above — what a
         letter and a clue number need on glass — and the two must be reviewed
         together if either moves.

         Measured with the switch disabled, it fails on SIX of the sixteen
         viewports: phone 390x844 at 20px, phone-393 at 20.5, phone-360 at
         16.4, phone-small 320x568 at 11.6, and the two touch landscape tablets
         at 21.1 and 25.5. Six and not nine — the three landscape PHONES draw
         2.7 to 3.4px and never reach here, because a landscape phone shows the
         rotate prompt instead of a board and `started` stays false. Counted by
         running the sabotage rather than by reading the viewport list, which
         would have said nine.

         Only where there is no saved preference. A player who has chosen a
         mode keeps it, so a run that somehow carried one would be measuring
         the preference rather than the default. */
