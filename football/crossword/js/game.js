  /* ---------- Clue wording ----------
     The bank writes whole sentences. Nothing wraps them here.

     There were CLUE_TEMPLATES: twelve categories, two phrasings each, picked by
     seed so wording varied between puzzles. That was written when those twelve
     categories held bare source terms — "Hill Dickinson Stadium" — and needed a
     frame to become a question.

     They are self-contained now, and the frame doubled them:
        "What the side at Nickname of the club that plays at Emirates Stadium
         are known as"

     The reason to remove rather than revert is not that QuickFire needs bare
     clues, though it does. It is that the templates only ever covered twelve
     categories of forty-two — the other thirty already shipped full sentences,
     and the old `if (!fns) return raw + hint` was the majority path. Removing
     the frame makes the bank consistent with itself, and that still holds if
     QuickFire never ships.

     What is lost: the same clue no longer reads two ways between puzzles. That
     was a real property and it applied to under a third of the bank, at the
     price of clues that could not be read outside this game. */
  function clueText(row) {
    /* The " - not " disambiguator needs no special handling now.

       It used to be cut out before templating and re-attached after, because a
       frame wrapped around "the Rovers - not Doncaster" would have read as a
       question about the whole string. With no frame the hint is simply part of
       the sentence, which is where it belonged.

       Worth recording why it was found: the separator was an em-dash, and a
       bank-wide ASCII fold turned it into a hyphen. game.js stopped matching at
       that point and nobody noticed, because a clue that fails to split still
       reads correctly — it just loses the visual break. Both the fold and the
       template removal are now moot for this, and the ASCII rule stands
       unbroken. */

  /* A finished board is kept, not thrown away.
     This deleted the slot the moment a result was banked, under a comment
     saying the save had nothing left to say. It had two problems.

     It did not work. The board is still open with complete = true when the
     prune runs, and save() treats a complete board as worth saving — `fresh`
     is only true with no letters, no clock AND not complete — so the next save
     wrote the slot straight back. save_test asserted the prune and passed,
     because it looked immediately after banking and before any later save.

     And it was the wrong intent anyway. Reopening a finished board should show
     what you did, the way Wordle does: going back to look at your grid, and
     showing someone else, is a large part of what a daily is for. Dordle
     cleared the board on reload and had to be talked out of it by a player who
     recommended it to a friend, went back to their own tab and found it blank.
     Keeping the board also means a result cannot be posted by somebody who has
     already seen the answer.

     So the behaviour that was happening by accident is now the behaviour, said
     out loud. What the old prune was right about is that slots accumulate one
     a day forever, so they are capped instead of deleted.

     KEPT_BOARDS is a month of looking back, which covers showing somebody your
     grid, and bounds the growth at roughly a few hundred KB against a 5MB
     budget. The result record is untouched and permanent — that is what My
     Season reads, and it is small. Only the grid goes.

     A down answer fills the frame top to bottom and sits centred left to

     bottom. So the word being typed is always as large as it can be and always
     in the same place, whichever way it runs.

     The zoom therefore changes between clues — a nine-letter down entry and an
     eight-letter across entry want different magnifications, and moving
     between them will visibly rescale. That is the cost of the board.kind and it is
     the point of it: predictable placement in exchange for a changing zoom.

     One limit, and it only bites on very short answers. Filling 393px with
     four letters means 98px squares, which is wall tiles rather than a
