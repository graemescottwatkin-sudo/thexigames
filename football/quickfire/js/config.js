    /* FIVE MATCH MINUTES PER WRONG PICK, the owner's number, set on 15 Sep 2026
       when the game became four options. It was 0 for the typing game, which
       had no concept of a wrong pick — a wrong guess cleared the cells and you
       typed again. With four options a blind pick is a free 25% unless being
       wrong costs more than thinking does.

       MINUTES AND NOT POINTS because the clock already punishes hesitation, so
       a points penalty punishes twice; a time penalty moves you down the same
       curve as everything else and costs more the earlier you were.

       AND IT LIVES HERE SO IT CAN BE MOVED. The same five minutes is worth
       between 0 and 36 points depending where the clock sits, because the bands
       are unequal — fifteen points between the first two and three between the
       last two. There is no timing-independent right value, so the only way
       anyone finds one is by playing it and changing this line. The SERVER
       reads this file rather than keeping its own copy.

       IT IS STILL 0, AND GOES TO 5 WITH THE CLIENT REWRITE. This value is read
       by the game that is live TODAY, which is the typing game — where a wrong
       guess clears the cells and you type again, repeatedly and by design.
       Setting it now would charge five minutes for each of those. The number is
       decided; it lands when there is a wrong PICK to charge for. */

    //   'none'              clear everything you typed.
