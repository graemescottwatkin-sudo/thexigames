/* deploy_check.mjs — QuickFire XI's gate.
 *
 * Carried over from the word search's, split honestly. The general checks come
 * across unchanged. The word-search-specific ones — the base-0 placement proof,
 * the ws- import resolver, the production SQL rule — are left behind rather
 * than reworded into something that passes here without meaning anything.
 *
 * Four checks are this game's own, and each one exists because of something
 * that has already happened during its build:
 *
 *   - the eleven rule, stated once. The scoring maximum, the questions per
 *     Daily and the bench size are one constant each, in js/config.js. A second
 *     copy in game.js is the one-fact-two-places fault that has cost this
 *     family a season table, a version string and a set of entrant keys.
 *   - no answers in the page. The bank lives in D1 and arrives from
 *     /api/quickfire/daily. This game has never shipped a schedule and must not
 *     acquire one.
 *   - the test hooks are guarded. QFX_TEST_REVEAL and QFX_TEST_ANSWER are how
 *     the jsdom suite drives the clock. On the live host they would be a cheat
 *     button, so they are defined only off it.
 *   - the answer row is the input. The board fixes the character count, so an
 *     alias of a different length can never be typed. A check on the client is
 *     not enough — the gate on the export refuses those rows — but the client
 *     must not claim to accept one either.
 *
 * Counts assertions, because a gate that does not count cannot tell a silent
 * skip from a pass.
