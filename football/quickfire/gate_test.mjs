/* gate_proof.mjs — proves deploy_check.mjs actually fails.

 *   node quickfire/gate_proof.mjs
 *
 * Breaks one rule at a time, restores the file, and asserts the gate named THAT
 * rule — not merely that something went red. A gate nobody has watched fail is
 * a gate trusted on faith, and this family has shipped three of those: the
 * tokens check that note()d for every build it existed, LAST_SHIPPED frozen at
 * a sentinel, and the live_check that read the wrong catalog key and reported
 * zero boards in green.
 *
 * Every case below is a fault that has happened, here or on a sibling game.

/* THE SABOTAGE THIS REPLACED no longer had anything to sabotage. It ungated a
   test hook — QFX_TEST_ANSWER, which handed back the current question's answer

   the four-option rewrite on 15 September 2026. A sabotage whose `from` string
   is absent applies nothing, the gate then passes because nothing was broken,
   and the prover reports a green it did not earn. That is this project's own
   "prove the sabotage applied" rule failing inside the prover itself.

   What guards the same ground now is a stronger claim: the page must not name
   the answer at all, because it is never sent one. That stopped being true on
   18 September 2026, when a wrong pick began to be told what the answer was:
   being marked wrong and not told leaves the player nothing to learn. The gate
   NARROWED rather than lifted — the answer may be read off the marking response
   and off nothing else — and this sabotage is unchanged because it is still
   exactly what the narrowed rule refuses: taking the answer off a question that
   is still in play. Only the name of the check being proved moved. */
