/* Scrambled XI — game.js
 *
 * The browser holds no names. It holds scrambles, positions and whatever the
 * server has told it, and every guess goes up to be marked. That is not
 * security theatre — the scramble IS the letters, so an anagram solver beats
 * this board however it is served — it is what stops the whole XI, its aliases
 * and its hint values riding down in the payload for free.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE (v001, first build on the monorepo):
 *   - no accounts, no challenges, no leaderboard. All three port from
 *     Crossword XI largely unchanged once the game is worth sharing.
 *   - no server-trusted score. There is no play row, so the number on the Full
 *     Time card is assembled here and the card says so. "Unverified" is the
 *     truth rather than a number that looks authoritative and is not.
 *   - no practice. There is now an archive picker and a finals catalogue; what
 *     is still missing is a practice mode, which this game may never want.

     where the next letter is going. On anything with a real keyboard nothing

     Only the letters, backspace and enter. Every guess is normalised to A-Z
