/* teamtalk_test.mjs — half time, and the free hints that make a board finishable.
 *
 * WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS. The team talk was the only path in the game that
 * nothing tested: automatic, free, and fired by the clock rather than by a
 * click, so no journey through the game ever reached it. It was then rewritten
 * from eleven parallel requests into one board-wide request — exactly the kind
 * of change that fails silently, because a player who never receives their
 * hints has nothing to see and nothing to report. An untested automatic path
 * is a path that only production tests.
 *
 * THE CLOCK IS THE INPUT, so the clock is what is faked. Date.now is replaced
 * before the scripts are evaluated and moved forward by hand; nothing else is
 * stubbed, and the real endpoint answers the real request.
