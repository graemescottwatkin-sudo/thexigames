/* scrambled/deploy_check.mjs — the gate Scrambled XI ships through.
 *
 * Run from the repository root, with no node_modules, no package.json and no
 * .wrangler in the tree. Those are checked, because a gate that passes on a
 * machine with build state and fails on Pages has told you nothing.
 *
 *   node scrambled/deploy_check.mjs        expect 0 failed
 *
 * THE TAG LAW. LAST_SHIPPED is what is LIVE, and LAST_SHIPPED_ASSETS is a hash
 * of the bytes it names. A tag is burned the moment it ships and never goes
 * backwards. Equal to LAST_SHIPPED is the RESTING state and passes — the tree
 * is what is live. What carries the law is the pair below it: if the bytes
 * changed, the tag must have moved, and if they did not, it must not have.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT SEE. It reads shape, not truth. It will pass a board
 * whose XI is wrong, a career that belongs to another player, or a scramble
 * that is unfair. The bank is checked by tools/build_scrambled.js --check and
 * by the author who sourced it; a green gate here is a well-formed release,
 * not a correct one.
