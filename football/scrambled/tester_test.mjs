/* ---- EVERYTHING THE HANDLERS REACH FOR IS IN THE FILE --------------------

   The tester is one HTML file with the real endpoint handlers inlined, their
   import lines stripped, above a fixed list of libraries. So an import ADDED
   to a handler and not added to that list leaves a free variable: the handler
   throws on its first call, the shim answers nothing, and the tester opens on
   a board that never loaded.

   That happened the day the archive gate landed — daily.js gained an import
   of _lib/archive.js and the list did not. The checks above caught it, which
   is why the tester is built and PLAYED in CI rather than only generated; but
   they caught it as "the shim answered for the board", four failures deep and
   a long way from the cause. This says the cause.

         count —

             var todaysNo = ((dailyNumber() - 1) % SC_BOARDS.length) + 1;

         — so with the bank present it resolves #12 and on a runner with only

         SERVER's ring number either way. Two numbers that are equal only when

         board rather than having quietly stopped. Which board the picker
