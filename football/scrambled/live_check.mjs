 * the two answer different questions: the gate says what would ship, this says
 * what did.
 *
 * THE FLOOR. MIN_ASSERTIONS is the second net under the completion marker: the
 * marker catches a crash, the floor catches a block that goes quiet without
 * crashing. It is set BELOW the run's real count on purpose, by the number of
 * assertions that can legitimately skip. When assertions are added, REVIEW the
 * floor rather than raising it by reflex — a floor set to the exact count
 * flaps on a legitimate skip, and a floor left alone for five releases stops
 * being able to refuse anything.
