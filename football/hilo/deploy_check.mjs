/* hilo/deploy_check.mjs — the gate HiLo XI ships through.
 *
 * Run from the repository root, with no node_modules, no package.json and no
 * .wrangler in the tree. Those are checked, because a gate that passes on a
 * machine with build state and fails on Pages has told you nothing.
 *
 *   node hilo/deploy_check.mjs        expect 0 failed
 *
 * THE TAG LAW. LAST_SHIPPED is what is LIVE, and LAST_SHIPPED_ASSETS is a hash
 * of the bytes it names. A tag is burned the moment it ships and never goes
 * backwards. Equal to LAST_SHIPPED is the RESTING state and passes — the tree
 * is what is live. What carries the law is the pair below it: if the bytes
 * changed, the tag must have moved, and if they did not, it must not have.
 *
 * WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT SEE. It reads shape, not truth. The boards are gated
 * by tools/import_hilo.js and verified by the research side against their
 * sources; a green gate here is a well-formed release, not a correct one.
