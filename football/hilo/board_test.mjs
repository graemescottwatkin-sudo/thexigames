   club field — so it has to name every family the content side writes, and
   the cost of missing one is silence rather than an error. It read
   `(managers|head coaches)` and matched 54 of the 274 club boards in the
   September import: the other 220 were filed as dailies, and a daily that is
   not on the calendar is refused by released(). They imported green and were
   unplayable and invisible. The importer printed "220 daily board(s) are not
   on the calendar", which reads like a scheduling note.

   THE HARD HALF IS THE PREFIX. Seven daily boards are categorised "Premier
   League appearances" with no club in front of them, beside 113 that read
   "Arsenal Premier League appearances". A rule matched on the tail alone
   claims both. So each family is checked in the pair it comes in: the club
