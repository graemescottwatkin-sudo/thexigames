/* WHOLE NUMBERS AS THEY ARE WRITTEN, NOT A SUBSTRING SCAN OF THE PAGE.
   This read doc.body.textContent and asked whether each value appeared in it
   anywhere. textContent runs every element's text together, so the ladder —
   eleven rungs numbered 1 to 11 — reads as "1234567891011", and a board whose
   second value was 78 was reported as leaking it. Nothing had leaked; rung 7
   sat next to rung 8.

   Read node by node it is still the whole page, so a value rendered anywhere
   is still caught; what it no longer does is invent a number out of two that
   happen to be adjacent. The ladder is left out because its text IS the
   numbers 1 to 11 and nothing else — a board whose value is 7 would otherwise
   be reported by the rung.

   THE ANSWER SHEET IS LEFT OUT FOR THE SAME REASON, found 19 Sep 2026 while
   chasing a different false positive on this line. Before a single call it is
   a skeleton of eleven rows reading "1" to "11" and nothing else, exactly like
   the ladder, and it was being scanned - so any board with a value of 2 to 11
   would have been reported as leaking it. Caps and goals do not reach down
   there, which is the only reason this had never fired; a category counting
   titles or trophies would have. Nothing is lost by excluding it, because the
   check below asserts the sheet is that skeleton and nothing more, which is a
   stronger statement than scanning it for digits. */

/* A NUMBER CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO A PLAYER, AND A CHAIN MAY REPEAT ONE.
   Board 1016 opens on Tony Adams with 66 caps and reaches Paul Scholes, who
   also has 66. The reference IS meant to be on the page — it is printed on the
   left, in the question and on both buttons — so scanning for the digits and
   blaming the later rung reported a leak on a board that had leaked nothing.
   It went red on 19 Sep 2026 and had been green the day before on board 1015,
   which happens to have no repeat: a suite that passes or fails on which
   board the calendar hands it is not measuring the code.

   So a value equal to the reference is exempt, and that is a REAL loss of
   cover, stated rather than hidden: if Scholes's 66 genuinely leaked, this
   could not see it, because 66 is already on the page legitimately and the two
   are the same two characters.

   A name-beside-a-number scan does not rescue it and was not written. The
   question reads "Paul Scholes — lower or higher than 66?", so the subject's
   name and the leaked digits sit in the same element on a repeat board by
   design — it would fail on 1016 for the same reason this did.

   What covers the exempted case is attribution BY SLOT rather than by digits,
   which a repeat cannot confuse: the right-hand value is a question mark, and
   nothing has settled yet, asserted below. A value can only be read off this
   page from a slot that belongs to a rung, and those slots are empty. */
