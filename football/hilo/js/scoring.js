/* HiLo XI — scoring.js: the owner's rules for this game, in one place.
 *
 * ELEVEN CLOCKS, ONE PER CALL. A call's clock starts when the call is shown.
 * It holds for a grace so the call can be read, then the call's points fall
 * in a straight line to zero at the end of the clock. A right call is worth
 * ten inside the grace, less the longer it takes, nothing at the last
 * instant; the floor is zero and it still costs no substitution. A call
 * that runs out is a wrong call. Twelve seconds, two of grace, ten falling a
 * point a second — so the number on the clock is the points on offer.
 *
 * SCORE. Up to ten for each right call, 110 for eleven, plus two for each
 * completed run of five right in a row: runs of five to nine earn two, ten
 * or eleven earn four, so two runs of five or a perfect eleven reach 114 and
 * nothing exceeds it. No time bonus.
 *
 * SUBSTITUTIONS. Three; each wrong call spends one. No other help.
 * RESULT. Win: eleven calls made with at most three wrong. Draw: finished
 * with four or more wrong. Loss: unfinished.
 *
 * Loaded by the page as a script and by the tests as a module; the same
 * numbers either way, which is the point of a file.

  /* THE CALL CLOCK, widened on the owner's ruling of 6 September 2026: five
     seconds before it starts to run, then twenty seconds to zero. It was two
     and ten, which cost a point a second — long enough to press a button you
     had already decided on and not long enough to think, so the clock was
     deciding calls that knowledge should have.
   *
     Ten points over twenty seconds is HALF A POINT A SECOND, which is the rate
     the owner asked for and is derived here rather than written down: CALL_MAX
     over (CLOCK_MS - GRACE_MS). Change either and the rate follows, which is
     why neither is a rate.
   *
     The score stays in whole points — worthAt rounds up, so the number on the
     clock when you press is the number you get — so at half a point a second
     the figure steps every two seconds rather than every one. That is the
     family's integer scoring, not a rounding accident: 114 is a whole number
