/* vowels/generated_test.mjs — Vowels XI is Scrambled XI's engine with the
 * other cypher, and this is what that must never stop meaning.
 *
 * The page and the script are GENERATED from scrambled/ by
 * tools/build_vowels.js, and `--check` in CI proves the files on disk are what
 * that generator produces. So this suite does not re-check the copying. It
 * checks the things a copy could get right and still be wrong about:
 *
 *   it is the CONSONANT cypher, always, and not by asking a query string
 *   it keeps its OWN keys, because board 7 here is not board 7 there
 *   it banks under its OWN entry key, for the same reason
 *   it shares the rules rather than copying them
 *   and the shared layer keeps its own version, not this game's tag
