# CLAUDE.md — The XI Games monorepo

Read this before doing anything. It is the project's law, learned the hard way;
every rule below exists because its absence cost a real release.

## What this is

A family of football-themed daily puzzle games at **thexigames.com**, targeting
eleven titles. FIVE are live, all under their theme: **Crossword XI**
(`/football/crossword/`), **Wordsearch XI**, **Scrambled XI**, **HiLo XI** and
**Vowels XI**. Cloudflare Pages + D1 (database `crosswordxi`) + Functions at the
repo root, shared by all games. The hub is `/index.html`; shared assets in
`shared/` (tokens, chrome). No package.json in the repo — Pages must not build.

**THE THEME IS THE FIRST PATH SEGMENT**, since 5 Sep 2026: other kinds of quiz
are coming — Friends, Game of Thrones — and XI never meant football. It is
three meanings: eleven clues, eleven games, eleven players to a team.

Where a game lives is ONE fact in ONE place, `functions/_lib/permalink.js`:
`gamePath(game)` for a URL, `gameDir(game)` for a file path, `THEME_OF` for the
map. Nothing else may assemble `"/" + game + "/"`. The move rewrote a hundred
literal paths across ninety files and every one of them was a place the theme
could later be wrong; the next theme is one function, not another sweep.

A game's **id is not its directory**. It is identified as `crossword` — in the
server's game list, in its results rows, in its storage prefix — and it LIVES at
`football/crossword`. They were the same word until the move and a dozen checks
assumed it. The id must not change when the theme does.

Old paths 301 to the new ones and always will: `/crossword/daily/5` is somebody's
link. `/football/` 302s to the hub — deliberately temporary, because the day a
second theme lands `/` becomes the picker and `/football/` becomes the football
hub. A 301 there would have to be un-cached from every browser that ever saw it.

## The tag law (non-negotiable)

- Versions: `vNNN` majors, minors walk the alphabet (`v001a` … `v001z < v002`).
- Each game's `deploy_check.mjs` holds `LAST_SHIPPED` (what is live) beside
  `LAST_SHIPPED_ASSETS` (a hash of the bytes it names). **A tag is burned the
  moment it ships, and a tag never goes backwards.** `LAST_PRESENTED` was
  retired in v001v: it tracked packages handed over, the zips have stopped, and
  a constant nothing moves is a comparison against nothing — the sentinel fault
  under another name.
- **Never change a tag or a `LAST_*` constant without saying so explicitly.**
- After every deploy: bump `LAST_SHIPPED` in BOTH gates to what is now live,
  commit, push. Skipping this widens the range the gate cannot refuse.
- A tag equal to `LAST_SHIPPED` is the RESTING state and passes: the tree is
  what is live. The gate refuses a tag that goes BACKWARDS, and the paired
  asset-hash check refuses changed bytes under a tag that has not moved —
  which is the half that carries the law. Until 3 Sep 2026 the gate demanded
  the tag be strictly ahead, so every commit after a post-deploy bump was red
  on every game, including games it never touched, and that red was expected
  and therefore unread.

## The deploy sequence

1. `rmdir /s /q node_modules` if present — **gates must run with no
   node_modules, no package.json, no .wrangler in the tree** (the gate checks).
2. Every game's gate, and there are SEVEN — five live plus QuickFire and
   Grid XI: `node football\crossword\deploy_check.mjs` and the same for
   `wordsearch`, `scrambled`, `hilo`, `vowels`, `quickfire`, `grid`. Expect
   **0 failed** on each. Grid XI's also refuses the things a LAUNCH would have
   to change — its absence from GAMES, from the squad and from the sitemap —
   so the game cannot go live by drift.
3. **Run the suites, CI-shaped.** There was no step 3 here for months and the
   gap was exactly this — on 5 Sep 2026 a push went out on green gates alone,
   and CI caught a suite the gates never run. Gates check the SHAPE of the
   tree; suites check its BEHAVIOUR, and neither substitutes for the other.
   `npm install -D jsdom acorn --no-save`, run every `*_test.mjs` from the
   repo root, then `rmdir /s /q node_modules` before going back to step 1.
   **The workflow's BUILD steps come first, and the roster is not the whole
   job.** `checks.yml` runs `tools/build_vowels.js --check`,
   `tools/build_scrambled_tester.js`, `tools/build_scrambled.js --check` and
   `tools/import_hilo.js --check` before or among the suites, and one of them
   WRITES: `scrambled-tester.html` is gitignored and rebuilt from Scrambled's
   files every run. On 6 Sep 2026 a green local sweep and a red CI differed by
   exactly that — the suite read a stale tester from a previous build while CI
   read a fresh one. Running the suites without the generators is not a
   CI-shaped run, it is a run against yesterday's artefacts.
   **And a runner has no BANK beside it.** `..\scrambledxi-source` and
   `..\crosswordxi-source` exist on the owner's machines and nowhere else, so
   generators fall back to the four-board sample in CI and a suite can pass
   here and fail there on nothing but board COUNT — the scrambled tester wraps
   the ring modulo its own set, resolving #12 with the bank and #4 without.
   To reproduce a runner: `git archive HEAD | tar -x -C <tmp>` and run there,
   where no bank is beside the checkout. Two red CI runs on 6 Sep 2026 were the
   same fix attempted twice without doing this once.
   The browser suites (`render_test`, `journey_test`, `signin_test`) do not
   run offline; CI is where they are proved.
4. Stage BY NAME, then commit and push. Not `git add -A`: other sessions edit
   this tree, and `-A` pushes their work past gates you never ran on it.
   Watch the Actions run (30+ jobs).
5. Every live game's live_check with `--expect`, five of them:
   `node football\crossword\live_check.mjs --expect vNNN` and the same for
   `wordsearch`, `scrambled`, `hilo`, `vowels` — including the HEAD assertions
   (production proof of `functions/_middleware.js`). The paths are under
   `football\` since the theme move; `node crossword\live_check.mjs` is a
   file that no longer exists.
6. `node tools\post_deploy.mjs` to see what it would record, then
   `--write` to apply it; commit "LAST_SHIPPED …", push. The script DERIVES:
   it reads the tag from the live page, recomputes each game's asset hash from
   the tree, and refuses unless the live tag equals the tree's AND that game's
   live_check passes — so a bump cannot be recorded for a deploy that never
   landed. It refuses for ALL games if any one is refused. Step 5 is still
   worth running by eye; the script runs it again as evidence, not as theatre.

A red gate is a stop, not a speed bump. If a gate fails, name the failing check
and diagnose before anything ships. Never push past a red gate.

## Reviewing a deployment (what "check the deploy" means)

- Live build tags match `origin/main`: footer `buildTag`, `js/game.js?v=` on
  every live game. Game assets must match the footer; `shared/` assets carry their
  own plain `vN` lifecycle and must NOT match the game tag.
- Every live_check passes with `--expect` — one per game, five of them.
- `results`/`plays` sanity via wrangler if relevant:
  `npx wrangler d1 execute crosswordxi --remote --command="..."`.
  **Never run a migration that is already applied** — `ALTER TABLE` is not
  idempotent. Migration state: **001–033 all applied** (002 was applied late,
  27 Aug; there is no 022 in the tree — the numbering skips it). Verified 5 Sep
  2026 against the live database: every table each migration creates exists,
  and `results.game` and `plays.game` are present for the two that only ALTER.
  031 (`ws_round`, `ws_find`, `ws_foul`) and 032 (`season_play`) confirmed
  present the same day. 033 (Grid XI: `gd_board`, `gd_schedule`, `gd_round`,
  `gd_guess`, `gd_hint`) applied 6 Sep 2026 and all five confirmed present; it
  is seven `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS` and nothing else, so it is safe to re-run.
  236 boards and 236 days imported the same day by `tools/import_grid.js`, and
  the calendar runs 2026-09-06 to 2027-04-29. THAT CALENDAR IS A PLACEHOLDER:
  it starts on the day of the import because the game has no page yet, and it
  must be re-imported with `--from=<launch day>` when Grid XI launches — the
  SQL clears `gd_schedule` first, so re-running it is the whole fix.
- HEAD on `/api/daily` and every game's `/…/answers/` answers 200, empty body,
  and `/api/*` carries `X-Robots-Tag: noindex`.

## Tests and gates — the rules of evidence

- **Every new check must be proven to FAIL before it is trusted.** Sabotage the
  thing it guards, watch it fail, restore. Six vacuous checks have been found
  in this project's history; this rule exists because of them.
  Proven by EXECUTION, not by parse — `node --check` proves a file parses, not
  that it runs; the crossword live_check's HEAD block shipped referencing a
  variable from the other game's file and crashed on first contact with
  production. And a check's name must not be broader than its behaviour — a
  check that samples one row while claiming to check all of them is the same
  fault quieter.
- **The live_check floors are a contract, not a formality.** `MIN_ASSERTIONS`
  in each `live_check.mjs` is the SECOND net under the completion guard: the
  end-of-run marker catches a crash, the floor catches a block that goes quiet
  without crashing. It is set BELOW the run's real count on purpose, by the
  number of assertions that can legitimately skip (a branch with nothing to
  refuse). So when assertions are added, REVIEW the floor rather than raising
  it by reflex — a floor set to the exact count flaps on a legitimate skip, and
  a floor left alone for five releases stops being able to refuse anything.
  Both floors drifted once already, in the release that introduced them.
- **A suite must not decide for itself what day it is.** The page decides from
  the server's Date header and falls back to LOCAL calendar days when it has
  none; a suite that computes the day from `Date.now()` disagrees with it
  across UTC midnight and all evening on any machine ahead of UTC, and the
  disagreement reads as lost saves. Take ONE reading, hand it to both sides
  (`save_test`, `adopt_test`, `tabs_test` pin their server's Date header to
  it), and ask first whether the page agrees. Where a zone is what is being
  proved, set `process.env.TZ` as fixture — `clock_test` does.
- **A stubbed database cannot prove a query.** The suites stub D1 and the
  stubs re-apply each rule in JS, which is right — a stub that rubber-stamped
  would prove nothing — but it means a bound dropped from real SQL passes
  offline. Found on 6 Sep 2026: removing the launch bound from the word
  search's seal left its suite green. What a suite can prove is that the code
  passes the right binds and reads the results correctly; the QUERY is proved
  in a live_check, and the check should be DERIVED (the answers index may not
  list more boards than the game has had days) rather than pinned to an id.
- **Regexes cannot count and cannot catch rule-bugs.** Anything about SQL
  arity, merge behaviour, or ordering must EXECUTE the real code.
- Totals only from CI-shaped runs: suites run **from the repo root**, after
  `npm install -D jsdom acorn --no-save`, and node_modules removed again before
  gates. Suite roster is in `.github/workflows/checks.yml`; the crossword gate
  asserts every `*_test.mjs` ANYWHERE in the repo is named there, and that
  every suite the workflow names exists. It walks the tree rather than holding
  a list of folders: it held `crossword`, `wordsearch`, `tools`, and when the
  games moved under `football/` two of those three stopped resolving and were
  skipped in silence — narrowing the check to `tools/` while it still reported
  a pass. Fifty-six suites in six folders were covered by nothing for a day.
  A floor refuses a walk that finds implausibly few, because a check that
  passes when it finds no problems also passes when it finds nothing at all.
- `tools/aligned_test.mjs` is the cross-game contract. **A new game is a row in
  its GAMES table** (dir, team-sheet name, storage prefix); its failures are
  the integration checklist. Run it first when integrating a game.
- Browser suites (`render_test`, `journey_test`, `signin_test`) run in the CI
  render job, not offline. `render_test` needs
  `BASE=http://127.0.0.1:8788/football/crossword/` against `wrangler pages dev`.

## One fact, one place (the project's core principle)

Every major bug traced to a value computed or stored twice that drifted.
Where facts live — extend these, never copy them:

- Games list + entry keys + `played_on`: `functions/_lib/games.js`
  (`daily:N` / `ws:YYYY-MM-DD`; a new game adds a prefix, never a column;
  game-specific facts go in `results.detail` as JSON).
- Daily key composition: `dailyKey()` in `functions/_lib/daily.js`, beside
  `ANSWERS_AFTER_DAYS` (the ONE answers window — never restate the number).
- WHEN EACH GAME LAUNCHED: `LAUNCHED` in `functions/_lib/games.js`, with
  `launchNumber()` beside it. A schedule cannot answer this — the word
  search's begins eight months before the game did, and the ring games have
  no schedule — and three pages were each guessing. Null means not launched,
  and a caller must not read that as day one.
- WHICH BOARDS EXIST: `boardKeys()` in `permalink.js` — the sitemap, each
  game's `/archive/` index and the route itself all ask it, so a ring game's
  1..today and a scheduled game's gaps have one answer. It promises nothing
  without a database (a list that 404s is worse than an empty page) where
  `ranOn` serves anyway (refusing a player who followed a link is worse).
- CSRF: `csrfOk`/`CSRF_HEADER` in `functions/_lib/auth.js` (`X-XI-Games`;
  legacy `X-Crossword-XI` accepted).
- Palette: `shared/xi-tokens.css`. Chrome (bar/drawer/footer + squad list):
  `shared/xi-chrome.{css,js}`. Games must not define `.xic-` rules or restate
  tokens — the gates check.
- localStorage: each game under its own prefix — `fcw.`, `xiws.`, `xisc.`,
  `xihl.`, `xivw.`; family-wide facts under `xi.` (`xi.theme`, `xi.attr`,
  `xi.season.v1`). Never write another game's prefix; reading one is fine and
  is how the hub knows what was played today.
- The season (one, at the top level, counting DAYS not points):
  `shared/xi-season.js` holds the rule AND the device's record, and
  `functions/_lib/season.js` imports that file rather than restating it — the
  hub computes a season for a player with no account, the server computes one
  for a player with an account, and two copies would be two answers about what
  a Tuesday was. Rows for a signed-in player: `functions/_lib/season-store.js`.
  Nothing is written for a player without an account.
- Merge rule (every game): **first result banked wins; the account's row wins
  outright on pull; unpushed local rows survive.**
- Account sync failures: log via `accountNote()`, stay caught, never surface
  to the player. A transient session failure is NOT signed-out.

## Shirt numbers

- A game takes the **next free number when it LAUNCHES**. Only a launched
  game holds a number; a game that is in build, on the drawing board or in
  testing does not, and moves down when a game ships past it. HiLo XI went
  out on 10 (its build brief said so), was renumbered to 9, and is 4 — the
  fourth game to launch — from 3 Sep 2026. **Launched games are 1 to 5**:
  Vowels XI took the fifth shirt when it launched on 4 Sep 2026, and QuickFire
  moved from 5 to 6 that day because a game in testing does not hold a number.
  Eleven shirts, so a launch pushes the tail down one and the squad loses an
  unsigned slot rather than growing a twelfth.
- The reorder is cheap and stays cheap: the number lives in the squad list in
  `shared/xi-chrome.js`, and the hub carries the strip, the card, the kit
  colour and the played-today check. Nothing else may hold a shirt number.
- Kit colours follow the GAME, not the number — `--kit-NN` is defined for the
  number a game actually wears.

## Content and safety rules

- **An unreleased game is named NOWHERE in served markup** (HTML comments
  exempt). Enforced by `chrome_test`, `aligned_test` and both live_checks.
  Unbuilt games appear only as shirt numbers + status.
- **The banks are secret.** `bank.json`, `ws-production.sql`, daily SQL files
  are gitignored and live OUTSIDE the repo
  (`..\crosswordxi-source`, `..\wordsearchxi-source`). Never commit them,
  never print answers into anything that ships. The D1 database is the only
  authoritative copy of the crossword bank — treat it accordingly.
- Answers pages: sealed until `ANSWERS_AFTER_DAYS` past a board's first day
  AS THE DAILY — which is not its first row in a schedule table. The word
  search's `ws_schedule` holds two years of inventory from 1 January 2026 and
  the game launched on 27 August, so the older rule published 233 boards that
  are dailies still to come: names, placements and the secret bonus word, live
  (found and closed 6 Sep 2026). A board that has never run publishes nothing;
  whether free play may OPEN it is a different question and still `released()`.
  Sealed/unknown/malformed ids get one identical 404 (no-store, noindex, zero
  content).
- Date/time: the SERVER decides what day it is, in UTC. Never compute a date
  client-side and send it up.

## Working style

- Root cause before solution: name the failure pattern, then fix it.
- Findings over vibes: five specific findings beat a general assessment.
- Honest failure reports — including when a check turns out vacuous.
- The repo may live at different paths per machine (OneDrive on one, `C:\Users\graem\repos\` on another); never hardcode either — resolve from the repo root.
- OneDrive hosts the repo: transient file locks happen; retry before diagnosing.
- Real-device checks (iPhone/iPad rotation) find bugs suites cannot; treat
  them as real.

## Known open items (do not "fix" without asking)

- Legal review: ON HOLD by owner decision.
- In-progress board sync: SHIPPED and confirmed on two devices (v001u).
- `preview_test` exits 0 with no preview (on record; fix or delete, not exempt).
