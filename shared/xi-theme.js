/* xi-theme.js — the family's theme, decided in one place and stamped early.
 *
 * LIGHT BY DEFAULT. The tokens switch on data-theme alone, and a page with
 * no attribute fell back to a media query, so a phone set to dark got the
 * dark palette on the hub, the answers pages and Scrambled — pages with no
 * toggle and no say — while the crossword resolved "auto" in its own script
 * and the word search in another. Three resolvers, three answers. This is
 * the one: the family key xi.theme (fcw.theme read as a fallback from the
 * days the crossword owned it), a stored choice honoured, "auto" following
 * the system, and NOTHING STORED meaning LIGHT — the owner's call, and the
 * palette the games were designed in.
 *
 * Loaded in <head>, synchronously and tiny, so the attribute is on the root
 * before the first paint and a dark-system phone never flashes dark first.
 * No dependencies; runs anywhere the tokens are linked.
