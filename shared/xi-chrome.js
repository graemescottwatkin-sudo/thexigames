/* xi-chrome.js v1 — the bar, the drawer and the footer, built once.
 *
 * WHY THE MARKUP IS BUILT HERE RATHER THAN WRITTEN INTO EACH PAGE. A squad list
 * copied into two HTML files is two lists, and game three makes it three. The
 * night this was written had already produced: a palette declared twice, the
 * word search's name in six places that had to be changed together, a build tag
 * three regexes disagreed about, and an INSERT whose columns and placeholders
 * stopped matching. Every one of them was the same fault. The squad is declared
 * once, below, and both games ask for it.
 *
 * RELEASED GAMES ARE NAMED; UNRELEASED ONES ARE NOT. live_check asserts the
 * site names no unbuilt game, and the hub already obeys it. A shirt number and
 * a status is all an unreleased slot gets — which happens to read as a team
 * sheet filling up.
 *
 * NO FRAMEWORK, NO BUILD STEP. Pages skips the build because there is no
 * package.json, by design. This is a plain script that runs on both games.
 *
 * THE ACCOUNT AND THE SETTINGS ARE IN HERE TOO. They were the crossword's: a
 * Sign in / Account / Settings trio in its bar, an account sheet of its own
 * and a settings menu built from its footer. Every other game had a sign-in
 * row hidden in the drawer and no settings at all, so "account and settings"
 * meant one thing on shirt 1 and nothing on the rest. The owner's rule is
 * that they are universal, so they are built here: one sheet, one menu, one
 * session, drawn into every bar the family has. A game adds its own rows to
 * the menu through XIChrome.addSetting and hears about the account through
 * the xi:account event; it draws none of this itself.

     regularly and already hold the names some of these were built under. So a

     CLEARING A RECORD, for the whole family.

     the word search, Scrambled and HiLo untouched — so a player who asked for
     a clean slate got one quarter of one, and no warning that the rest had
     survived. The server side was already right: the endpoint deletes every
     result the account holds, whatever game it came from.

     writes another game's prefix, and it is a good rule — this is the one
     operation that has to reach all of them, so it belongs to the layer that
     belongs to all of them. A game asks; the chrome sweeps.

     WHAT IS A RECORD AND WHAT IS A PREFERENCE. A reset clears what you have
     DONE, never how you like the thing to look, and never who you are: the
     club you play as, the palette, the board settings and the device code all
     stay. The keeps are listed by name so each one reads as a decision rather

   * reads season_play; it names the games now, and this is the one place that
   * asks. Cached for the life of the page, because the answer cannot change
   * without this device being the one that changed it.
   *
   * NULL IS NOT AN EMPTY LIST, and the difference is the whole point: null
   * means "not signed in, or could not ask", and a caller must then fall back
   * to its own storage rather than conclude nothing has been played. An empty
   * ARRAY means the account answered and today is untouched.

  /* THE SAME ANSWER, SYNCHRONOUSLY, for the checks that cannot wait. Every
     game's "have I played today" test is a synchronous read of localStorage
     inside a click handler, and rewriting five of those into promises to ask
     one question would be a large change for a small fact. So the fetch is
     started at init and this reads what came back.
   *
   * NULL MEANS "NOT KNOWN", and never "not played". Not signed in, the answer
     not yet arrived, or the request failed — in all three the caller falls
     back to its own record, which is exactly right for a signed-out player and
     is the behaviour every game already had. The window where it is null and
     an account exists is the moment between load and the season answering;
     HiLo's kick-off closes that one properly by awaiting the promise, and it
     is the pattern to copy if any other game turns out to need it. */
