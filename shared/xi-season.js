/* xi-season.js — one season, at the top level: the rule, and the device's record.
 *
 * THE OWNER'S RULE, in their words: "max of 1 win per day / finish a puzzle =
 * Draw / finish 2+ puzzles = win / start a puzzle and dont finish = loss
 * (unless you have 1+ already complete)".
 *
 *   finished 2 or more        W
 *   finished exactly 1        D
 *   started, finished none    L
 *   started nothing           no fixture — not a loss, not a blank result
 *
 * Finishing one and abandoning another is a DRAW. An unfinished puzzle only
 * counts against a day with nothing completed, which is what "unless you have
 * 1+ already complete" says.
 *
 * WHY THIS COUNTS FINISHES AND NOT POINTS. There is one season and it belongs
 * to the family, not to a game — and other kinds of quiz are coming that will
 * not use the 114 scoring. Nothing here knows what a puzzle is marked out of,
 * so a Friends crossword joins a season without changing a line of it. The
 * per-game LIVE TABLE is the other half and is football's alone: 114 = 38
 * matches at 3 points, and a Friends crossword cannot have a position in the
 * Premier League table.
 *
 * WHY THE RULE IS IN shared/ AND NOT IN functions/. Because there are two
 * branches and they must give one answer:
 *
 *   an account   the server reads season_play and answers /api/season
 *   no account   this file's own record, read by the hub, and the server
 *                never learns they played at all
 *
 * functions/_lib/season.js imports this file rather than restating it — the
 * same arrangement the games' scoring.js files already have with the Workers
 * that verify them. A rule written twice would be two answers about what a
 * Tuesday was, and the second one would be found by a player, not by a test.
 *
 * THE DAY ALWAYS COMES FROM THE SERVER. Every function here that stores
 * something takes the day as an argument and refuses without it. A device
 * clock is wrong often enough — a phone an hour behind, a traveller, a
 * deliberately wound-back tablet — that a season keyed on it would be a
 * different season on every device the player owns. /api/play answers with
 * the server's UTC day on the two calls that matter, and xi-plays.js hands
 * that day straight here. No day, no row: an unrecorded start is a small
 * loss, an invented one is a wrong season.
 *
 *   XISeason.noteStart(game, day) / noteFinish(game, day)  -> true if stored
 *   XISeason.days()          -> [{ day, started, finished }] newest first
 *   XISeason.season(days, today)                           -> the table

  /* ---- THE DEVICE'S OWN RECORD -----------------------------------------
     Family-wide, so it lives under `xi.` — a season spans the games and
     belongs to none of them, and filing it under any one game's prefix would
     make that game's storage the season's home.

     WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The games' results lists hold FINISHES: a board
     abandoned halfway leaves a save file, not a result. So a season computed
     from them could never see a loss, and every day a player turned up would
     read as a draw or a win. The two facts the rule needs — how many started,
     how many finished — are only both known at the moment they happen, which
     is where this is written from.

     Games are NAMED rather than counted, which makes a double start free:
     a reload, a double tap and a resumed round all add "crossword" to a set
     that already contains it. That is the same reason the server's table has
